# A SwiftUI Messenger App

This is the beginning of a fully function messenger app. The goal is to recreate Appls's Messenger. Currently it is only using static data and I am current try to work with SwfitUI to implement Networking and actual user response functionality. This may take some time as SwiftUI is brand new and there are some bugs, as you may expect, involved with this.
